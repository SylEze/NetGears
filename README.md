NetGears is a StreetGears server-side emulator built with C# and .Net Core.

This project has been started because the official servers are no longer available thus you cannot play anymore.

It has also been started for learning purposes about MMO servers logic and networking.

You can use this repository to document yourself about StreetGears logic, we try to write the more understandable documentation as we can.
